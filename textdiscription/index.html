	<h1><blockquote>text:discription</blockquote></h1>

	<p><blockquote>For my text project I decided to create a webpage that featured two contrasting conversations. One with an ex boyfriend and one with my current boyfriend. I was receiving both of these messages simultaneously and on a walk home from class that night I realized that the content of both conversations were kind of poetic in a way. One a routine message between two current lovers and the other an unexpected message from an old flame. I decided that these would be interesting subjects for comparing two different texts. In order to achieve  the design that I wanted I decided to create two separate iFrames in HTML to house the text messages. In order to make the page interactive I chose to create different links for each message and once you clicked each link the message prior would stay on the screen in order to see the conversations progression. Each person contributing to the conversations have their own color (my responses are  the same color in both).  I was really inspired by internet artist Damon Zucconi. A Philadelphia based photographer and graphic designer who creates both interesting images and really interactive websites. One of his internet works i found partially helpful is called is called “All Things Considered” which features three iMessage looking conversations happening simultaneously. I tried to achieve something similar to this with my text project.</blockquote> </p>
