<h1>Magic 8 Ball</h1>
<p>For this assignment we had to design a screensaver. I chose to create a magic 8 ball that will give you vauge but sarcastic and harsh predictions/answers. After many failed attempts at creating each indevidual message in css, I decided to make indevidual png files for each message and then shuffle them through javascript so each time the ball shakes a new message apppears. </p>
