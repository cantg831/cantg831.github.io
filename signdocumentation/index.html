	<p>Project Prompt:Build an interactive
digital sign for a cultural
institution in New York. How can identity
be expressed in a
dynamic way?</p>
	<p>Responce: I choose to creat a memorial/informational sign for 5 Pointz a graffiti mecca that once lived in Long Island City, Queens. 5 Pointz was once an abondoned wear house that became the epicenter for graffiti artists.On this sign one can find some examples of work done by 5 Pointz most popular artists, information about 5 pointz and its founder and articles about 5 Pointz from the press.</p>
