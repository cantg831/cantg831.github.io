	<h1>Damon Zucconi: A Fan Page</h1>
	<h2>A Philadelphia based Internet Artist</h2>
	<h3>Apparently he was born in 1985</h3>
	<p>
		Damon Zucconi is a photographer and  internet artisit based in Philadelphia. According to his artisit profile featured on Rhizome he states: <blockquote>"I'm interested in forms of production where publishing is more of a side effect, rather than a terminal state, and that tends to necessitate working out in the open. But this interest stems less from the ethics of open source and the "bazaar" models of collaboration that are wrapped up in it, and more from how process at large becomes part of the public record.</blockquote>

	<blockquote> "I do pay attention to the use-value others uncover in the work, as this frequently alters meaning, or maybe guides my hand later on. Anything made with a kind of structural openness is going to have new uses found for it, but both the consequences, and the fact that there are consequences at all, is somewhat adjacent to my intent. 
		"</blockquote>
